![US Biomass](man/figures/usBiomass.jpg)

The goal of `rFIA` is to increase the accessibility and use of the USFS
Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Database by providing a
user-friendly, open source platform to easily query and analyze FIA
Data. Designed to accommodate a wide range of potential user objectives,
`rFIA` simplifies the estimation of forest variables from the FIA
Database and allows all R users (experts and newcomers alike) to unlock
the flexibility and potential inherent to the Enhanced FIA design.

Specifically, `rFIA` improves accessibility to the spatio-temporal
estimation capacity of the FIA Database by producing space-time indexed
summaries of forest variables within user-defined population boundaries.
Direct integration with other popular R packages (e.g., dplyr, sp, and
sf) facilitates efficient space-time query and data summary, and
supports common data representations and API design. The package
implements design-based estimation procedures outlined by Bechtold &
Patterson (2005), and has been validated against estimates and sampling
errors produced by EVALIDator. Current development is focused on the
implementation of spatially-enabled model-assisted estimators to improve
population, change, and ratio estimates.

## Example Usage

### *Download FIA Data and Load into R*

The first step to using `rFIA` is to download subsets of the FIA
Database. The easiest way to accomplish this is using `getFIA`. Using
one line of code, you can download state subsets of the FIA Database,
load data into your R environment, and optionally save those data to a
local directory for future use\!

``` r
## Download the state subset or Connecticut (requires an internet connection)
# All data acquired from FIA Datamart: https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/datamart.html
ct <- getFIA(states = 'CT', dir = '/path/to/save/data')
```

By default, `getFIA` only loads the portions of the database required to
produce summaries with other `rFIA` functions (`common = TRUE`). This
conserves memory on your machine and speeds download time. If you would
like to download all available tables for a state, simple specify
`common = FALSE` in the call to `getFIA`.

**But what if I want to load multiple states worth of FIA data into R?**
No problem\! Simply specify mutiple state abbreviations in the `states`
argument of `getFIA` (e.g. `states = c('MI', 'IN', 'WI', 'IL'`)), and
all state subsets will be downloaded and merged into a single
`FIA.Database` object. This will allow you to use other `rFIA` functions
to produce estimates within polygons which straddle state boundaries\!

Note: given the massive size of the full FIA Database, users are
cautioned to only download the subsets containing their region of
interest.

**If you have previously downloaded FIA data would simply like to load
into R from a local directory, use `readFIA`:**

``` r
## Load FIA Data from a local directory
db <- readFIA('/path/to/your/directory/')
```

-----

### *Compute Estimates of Forest Variables*

Now that you have loaded your FIA data into R, it’s time to put it to
work. Let’s explore the basic functionality of `rFIA` with `tpa`, a
function to compute tree abundance estimates (TPA, BAA, & relative
abundance) from FIA data, and `fiaRI`, a subset of the FIA Database for
Rhode Island including inventories from 2013-2018.

**Estimate the abundance of live trees in Rhode Island:**

``` r
library(rFIA)
## Load the Rhode Island subset of the FIADB (included w/ rFIA)
## NOTE: This object can be produced using getFIA and/or readFIA
data("fiaRI")

## Only estimates for the most recent inventory year
fiaRI_MR <- clipFIA(fiaRI, mostRecent = TRUE) ## subset the most recent data
tpaRI_MR <- tpa(fiaRI_MR)
head(tpaRI_MR)
#> # A tibble: 1 x 8
#>    YEAR   TPA   BAA TPA_SE BAA_SE nPlots_TREE nPlots_AREA     N
#>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>       <int>       <int> <int>
#> 1  2018  427.  122.   6.63   3.06         126         127   199

## All Inventory Years Available (i.e., returns a time series)
tpaRI <- tpa(fiaRI)
head(tpaRI)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 8
#>    YEAR   TPA   BAA TPA_SE BAA_SE nPlots_TREE nPlots_AREA     N
#>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>       <int>       <int> <int>
#> 1  2014  466.  120.   6.73   3.09         121         123   196
#> 2  2015  444.  121.   6.40   3.06         122         124   194
#> 3  2016  450.  123.   6.46   2.94         124         125   197
#> 4  2017  441.  123.   6.66   3.01         124         125   196
#> 5  2018  427.  122.   6.63   3.06         126         127   199
```

**What if I want to group estimates by species? How about by size
class?**

``` r
## Group estimates by species
tpaRI_species <- tpa(fiaRI_MR, bySpecies = TRUE)
head(tpaRI_species, n = 3)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 11
#>    YEAR  SPCD COMMON_NAME        SCIENTIFIC_NAME        TPA    BAA TPA_SE BAA_SE
#>   <int> <int> <chr>              <chr>                <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1  2018    12 balsam fir         Abies balsamea      0.0873 0.0295  114.   114. 
#> 2  2018    43 Atlantic white-ce… Chamaecyparis thyo… 0.247  0.180    59.1   56.0
#> 3  2018    68 eastern redcedar   Juniperus virginia… 1.14   0.138    64.8   67.5
#> # … with 3 more variables: nPlots_TREE <int>, nPlots_AREA <int>, N <int>

## Group estimates by size class
## NOTE: Default 2-inch size classes, but you can make your own using makeClasses()
tpaRI_sizeClass <- tpa(fiaRI_MR, bySizeClass = TRUE)
head(tpaRI_sizeClass, n = 3)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 9
#>    YEAR sizeClass   TPA   BAA TPA_SE BAA_SE nPlots_TREE nPlots_AREA     N
#>   <int>     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>       <int>       <int> <int>
#> 1  2018         1 188.   3.57  13.0   12.8           76         127   199
#> 2  2018         3  68.6  5.76  15.1   15.8           46         127   199
#> 3  2018         5  46.5  9.06   6.51   6.57         115         127   199

## Group by species and size class, and plot the distribution 
##  for the most recent inventory year
tpaRI_spsc <- tpa(fiaRI_MR, bySpecies = TRUE, bySizeClass = TRUE)
plotFIA(tpaRI_spsc, BAA, grp = COMMON_NAME, x = sizeClass,
        plot.title = 'Size-class distributions of BAA by species', 
        x.lab = 'Size Class (inches)', text.size = .75,
        n.max = 5) # Only want the top 5 species, try n.max = -5 for bottom 5
```

**What if I want estimates for a specific type of tree (ex. greater than
12-inches DBH and in a canopy dominant or subdominant position) in
specific area (ex. growing on mesic sites), and I want to group by
estimates by some variable other than species or size class (ex.
ownsership group)?** Easy\! Each of these specifications are described
in the FIA Database, and all `rFIA` functions can leverage these data to
easily implement complex queries\!

``` r
## grpBy specifies what to group estimates by (just like species and size class above)
## treeDomain describes the trees of interest, in terms of FIA variables 
## areaDomain, just like above,describes the land area of interest
tpaRI_own <- tpa(fiaRI_MR, 
                     grpBy = OWNGRPCD, 
                     treeDomain = DIA > 12 & CCLCD %in% c(1,2),
                     areaDomain = PHYSCLCD %in% c(20:29))
head(tpaRI_own)
#> # A tibble: 2 x 9
#>    YEAR OWNGRPCD   TPA   BAA TPA_SE BAA_SE nPlots_TREE nPlots_AREA     N
#>   <int>    <int> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>       <int>       <int> <int>
#> 1  2018       30 0.848  3.57   59.0   59.1           3          38   199
#> 2  2018       40 1.49   3.99   25.7   27.7          12          82   199
```

**What if I want to produce estimates within my own population
boundaries (within user-defined spatial zones/polygons)?** This is where
things get really exciting.

``` r
## Load the county boundaries for Rhode Island
data('countiesRI') ## Load your own spatial data from shapefiles using readOGR() (rgdal)

## polys specifies the polygons (zones) where you are interested in producing estimates
## returnSpatial = TRUE indicates that the resulting estimates will be joined with the 
##    polygons we specified, thus allowing us to visualize the estimates across space
tpaRI_counties <- tpa(fiaRI_MR, polys = countiesRI, returnSpatial = TRUE)

## NOTE: Any grey polygons below simply means no FIA data was available for that region
plotFIA(tpaRI_counties, BAA) # Plotting method for spatial FIA summaries, also try 'TPA' or 'TPA_PERC'
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="100%" />

**We produced a really cool time series earlier, how would I marry the
spatial and temporal capacity of `rFIA` to produce estimates across
user-defined polygons and through time?** Easy\! Just hand `tpa` the
full FIA.Database object you produced with `readFIA` (not the most
recent subset produced with `clipFIA`). For stunning space-time
visualizations, hand the output of `tpa` to `plotFIA`. To save the
animation as a .gif file, simpy specify `fileName` (name of output file)
and `savePath` (directory to save file, combined with `fileName`).

``` r
## Using the full FIA dataset, all available inventories
tpaRI_st <- tpa(fiaRI, polys = countiesRI, returnSpatial = TRUE)

## Animate the output
library(gganimate)
plotFIA(tpaRI_st, TPA, animate = TRUE, legend.title = 'Abundance (TPA)', legend.height = .8)
#> NULL
```
